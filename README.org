#+TITLE: jsf-date-repro

* Running
Run `main.js`, passing it an argument to use as a random seed:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ node src/main.js some_seed
#+END_SRC
Note that when the program is run repeatedly with the same seed, the ~builtinDatetime~ correctly uses the seed, but the ~customDatetime~ does not (the time advances with real time).
